## Welcome to Cedalio!
Bifrost is a <strong>Decentralized Storage GraphQL Gateway</strong>, you can use Bifrost as a decentralized database for applications that speak GraphQL. 

Bifrost is designed in such a way that allows end-users to <strong>own and control their data</strong>. Also helps developers focus on <strong>building applications and avoid having to worry about managing infrastructure, building a backend, write smart-contracts or write GraphQL resolvers</strong>. 

As a developer <strong>allyou need to do is define your data model using GraphQL Schema</strong> Definition Language and that's it! To learn more about how our technology works read our Solution blueprint and Building blocks.
